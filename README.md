<h1>About this project:</h1>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop a system capable of detecting tampered or manipulated audio files using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). With the increasing prevalence of audio-based media, there is a growing need to verify the authenticity of audio content, especially in areas like news broadcasting, forensic analysis, and digital rights management. This project aims to leverage the power of deep learning, specifically CNNs, to automatically identify and classify audio as either genuine or tampered.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This project uses deep learning models to detect audio tampering. The key features of the project 
        include extracting audio features, training a CNN-based model, and classifying the audio files. 
        The project focuses on providing a scalable and reliable solution for identifying tampered audio files.
